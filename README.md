### Time-series modelling
* __M5 Kaggle forecasting competitions__ for accuracy (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/163414) and uncertainty (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-uncertainty/discussion/163415). Has an absolute wealth of information, as one would expect for anything Kaggle related, for time series forecasting.
* __Hyndman, R.J. and Athanasopoulos, G., 2018. Forecasting: principles and practice. OTexts.__, online book by some of the leaders in the field (https://otexts.com/fpp2/).

### Uncertainty quantification
_Have found these blogs to be really nice overviews of promising techniques in deep learning:_
* __Inovex blog__, which also has an associated by Florian Wilhelm: https://www.inovex.de/blog/uncertainty-quantification-deep-learning/
* __Guilherme Duarte Marmerola's blog__, has some excellent stuff on quantile regression (https://gdmarmerola.github.io/risk-and-uncertainty-deep-learning/) and a form of deep ensembles, referred to as randomised prior functions (https://gdmarmerola.github.io/intro-randomized-prior-functions/). More generally, I think Guilherme's blog gives really nice high level overviews of some interesting directions in ML such as casual inference, amongst other things.
