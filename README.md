# useful-stuff
A repo containing links to useful blogs, papers and everything in between (or outside) for ML and data science...

### Gaussian processes
_Plenty of good stuff out there. For the basics I've found the following blogs and videos very helpful_
* __A visual exploration of GPs__ (https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/); nice and interactive blog post.
* __GPs, not quite for dummies__ (https://yugeten.github.io/posts/2019/09/GP/); again, another nice blog post that explains things simply and has a link to an informative video on GPs by Richard Turner.

### Loss functions
_Something I'm still getting to grips with are how we choose and implement our loss functions in various learning algorithms (but mainly DL). Here are some useful links to describe rationals and implementation aspects:_
* __Honey I shrunk the target variable__ (https://florianwilhelm.info/2020/05/honey_i_shrunk_the_target_variable/); besides being an entertaining read from Florian Wilhelm, is a very informative blog post on target transformations and what these mean for loss functions.

### Renewable energy vs machine learning
_Some interesting works (and blogs) for those using ML technqiues in renewable energy domains:_
* __Charilaos Mylonas' blog__ (https://mylonasc.github.io/aboutme/); Awesome blog on some really innovative techniques (generative models, graph nets), for failure detection in wind farms. 

### Time-series modelling
* __M5 Kaggle forecasting competitions__ for accuracy (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/163414) and uncertainty (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-uncertainty/discussion/163415). Has an absolute wealth of information, as one would expect for anything Kaggle related, for time series forecasting.
* __Hyndman, R.J. and Athanasopoulos, G., 2018. Forecasting: principles and practice. OTexts.__; online book by some of the leaders in the field (https://otexts.com/fpp2/).

### Uncertainty quantification
_Have found these blogs to be really nice overviews of promising techniques for UQ in deep learning:_
* __Inovex blog__ (https://www.inovex.de/blog/uncertainty-quantification-deep-learning/); which also has an associated video presented by Florian Wilhelm on this work.
* __Guilherme Duarte Marmerola's blog__, has some excellent stuff on quantile regression (https://gdmarmerola.github.io/risk-and-uncertainty-deep-learning/) and a form of deep ensembles, referred to as randomised prior functions (https://gdmarmerola.github.io/intro-randomized-prior-functions/). More generally, I think Guilherme's blog gives really nice high level overviews of some interesting directions in ML such as casual inference, amongst other things.
